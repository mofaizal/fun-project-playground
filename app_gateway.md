Azure Application Gateway design, there are several best practices and insights to consider for security, scalability, and reliability. Let’s break it down step-by-step and propose optimizations as well:

### Key Best Practices:

#### 1. **Security Considerations**:
   - **Network Segmentation**: Ensure each application (A, B, C) is hosted on its own subnet for isolation. Network Security Groups (NSGs) can be applied at the subnet level to control inbound and outbound traffic.
     - *Pros*: Minimizes risk of lateral movement between apps.
     - *Cons*: Can increase complexity in managing and troubleshooting network policies.
   - **Firewall Protection**: Ensure both the DMZ Secure Hub and Internal Secure Hub have Azure Firewall or third-party Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) to inspect and filter traffic, adding an extra layer of defense.
     - *Pros*: Protects internal services from threats while ensuring only legitimate traffic reaches the backend.
     - *Cons*: Adds additional latency and cost.
   - **App Gateway Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Enable the WAF on the Application Gateway to protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
     - *Pros*: Built-in security without needing third-party appliances.
     - *Cons*: Needs careful configuration and tuning to avoid false positives or blocking legitimate traffic.

#### 2. **Avoiding Single Points of Failure**:
   - **Redundant Gateways**: Ensure the App Gateways (both external and internal) are deployed in a highly available configuration across Availability Zones, if available in your region.
     - *Pros*: Increases resilience against zone-level failures.
     - *Cons*: Slightly higher cost but provides better reliability.
   - **Multiple Backend Pools**: Use multiple backend pools for each application to distribute the load evenly and avoid bottlenecks. Ensure these pools are scalable and hosted across multiple availability zones.
   - **Health Probes**: Configure health probes on the Application Gateway to monitor the status of the backend applications. If a backend becomes unhealthy, traffic can be routed to other available backend servers.

#### 3. **Minimizing Human Error**:
   - **Configuration as Code**: Use Terraform or ARM templates to manage and deploy configuration changes. This allows for version control, peer review, and rollback in case of misconfiguration.
     - *Pros*: Helps prevent accidental misconfiguration or human errors.
     - *Cons*: Requires upfront investment in setting up Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
   - **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Limit access to the Azure resources (e.g., App Gateway, NSG, etc.) based on roles, ensuring that only authorized personnel can make changes. Implement separation of duties to reduce risks.

#### 4. **Scalability & Reliability**:
   - **Autoscaling Application Gateway**: Leverage Application Gateway autoscaling to handle traffic surges dynamically without over-provisioning.
     - *Pros*: Better cost control and scalability.
     - *Cons*: Autoscaling might take a few minutes to adjust, so plan for traffic patterns accordingly.
   - **Backend Pool Scaling**: Ensure backend applications can scale (e.g., using Virtual Machine Scale Sets, App Services, or containerized solutions). Set autoscaling policies based on load to handle varying traffic.

#### 5. **Application Segmentation (Prevent Cross-App Communication)**:
   - **NSGs with Strict Rules**: Apply NSGs to control traffic between Application A, B, and C. Ensure that traffic between different subnets (applications) is restricted, preventing cross-application communication unless explicitly allowed.
     - *Pros*: Secure isolation between different applications.
     - *Cons*: Complex NSG rules might require fine-tuning.
   - **Application Security Groups (ASGs)**: Use ASGs in conjunction with NSGs to further simplify and manage communication policies between specific applications.
   - **Private Link**: Use Azure Private Link to isolate backend applications further and allow secure access without exposing the services to the public internet.

### Scalability Limits:
   - Application Gateway has limits on the number of backend pools, HTTP listeners, and rule configurations. Be mindful of these limits based on your scaling needs and plan accordingly.
   - There are also constraints on the number of routes and rule combinations that can be defined. Monitor these and manage configuration complexity.

Azure Application Gateway has specific limits related to backend pools, HTTP listeners, rule configurations, routes, and other resources that must be considered to ensure efficient scaling and management of complexity. Below are detailed insights into these limits and how they impact your design and scaling:

#### 1. **Backend Pools**
   - **Limit**: 
     - Maximum of 100 backend pools per Application Gateway (as of now).
   - **What to be mindful of**:
     - Each backend pool can be associated with one or more listeners. If your architecture requires numerous backend pools for different applications or services, you could quickly approach the limit. 
     - If you need more backend pools than the limit allows, consider breaking the architecture into multiple Application Gateways or consolidating backend services where possible.

#### 2. **HTTP Listeners**
   - **Limit**:
     - A maximum of 200 listeners per Application Gateway.
   - **What to be mindful of**:
     - HTTP listeners are tied to unique front-end IP configurations, ports, and host names. If your design has multiple subdomains or host names, each requiring a separate listener, this can consume the available listener limit.
     - Be cautious when setting up multiple applications or microservices that require their own listeners. Consider consolidating host names or domains if feasible to save resources.

#### 3. **Rule Configurations (Basic and Path-Based Routing Rules)**
   - **Limit**:
     - Application Gateway supports up to 400 routing rules (which include both basic rules and path-based routing rules).
   - **What to be mindful of**:
     - Path-based routing rules are powerful but can consume your rule limit quickly if you use fine-grained routes for many different paths across multiple backend pools. 
     - To avoid complexity, simplify routing configurations by grouping similar requests or using regular expressions in path-based routing where possible.

#### 4. **Constraints on Routes and Rule Combinations**
   - **Limit**:
     - Each routing rule is associated with a listener, and as mentioned, a maximum of 400 routing rules can be defined per Application Gateway.
     - A single route within a path-based rule can have multiple paths, but the overall number of combinations (listeners, routes, path rules, etc.) can add complexity and may become hard to manage.
   - **What to be mindful of**:
     - As your deployment scales, the number of combinations of listeners, routing rules, and backend pools can multiply. Managing hundreds of rules manually can introduce configuration errors and increase the risk of misrouting or misconfigurations.
     - Consider using automation tools (such as Terraform or ARM templates) for configuring these rules to manage complexity and ensure consistency. Properly document your routing rules to prevent errors during modifications.

#### 5. **SSL Certificates**
   - **Limit**:
     - Application Gateway supports up to 100 SSL certificates.
   - **What to be mindful of**:
     - Each listener can be associated with its own SSL certificate. If your design uses many SSL-secured subdomains or services, you may hit this limit quickly.
     - To manage this efficiently, consider using wildcard certificates (e.g., `*.yourdomain.com`) to cover multiple subdomains under a single certificate.

#### 6. **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Policies**
   - **Limit**:
     - A maximum of 100 WAF policies per Application Gateway.
   - **What to be mindful of**:
     - Each WAF policy can apply to different listeners or routing rules, and excessive policies could reduce manageability and performance.
     - Centralize WAF policies where possible by reusing the same WAF rules for similar traffic patterns or applications.

#### 7. **HTTP Headers and Cookies**:
   - **Limit**:
     - Each Application Gateway has limits on the size and number of HTTP headers and cookies it can process. It can support up to 100 custom HTTP headers per request and response.
   - **What to be mindful of**:
     - Overly complex HTTP headers or large cookie sizes may result in performance degradation. Keep custom headers and cookies to a necessary minimum for efficiency.

#### 8. **Scaling Considerations**:
   - **Scaling the Application Gateway**: Application Gateway has an autoscaling feature, which can adjust the number of instances based on traffic load. However, the scale-out may take several minutes to react to sudden traffic spikes.
     - To plan for scaling, ensure that you have configured the autoscale policy appropriately to handle peak loads.
     - The Application Gateway SKU (Standard v2 or WAF v2) allows for autoscaling, whereas the Standard SKU does not. Choose your SKU accordingly based on the required level of scaling.

#### 9. **Monitoring and Managing Complexity**:
   - **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on CPU utilization, memory, and other key metrics to identify if the Application Gateway is approaching its limits. Azure Monitor and Azure Application Insights can help track performance.
   - **Configuration Complexity**: With multiple listeners, backend pools, rules, and certificates, managing complexity can be a challenge. Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to automate and standardize the deployment process to minimize errors.
   - **Traffic Distribution**: Leverage Application Gateway’s support for multiple regions and Availability Zones to distribute traffic globally and across different zones, reducing the impact of regional failures.
   - **Operational Limits**: Make sure your design takes into account the operational limits of Application Gateway and consider breaking large-scale deployments into smaller, manageable units (e.g., using multiple Application Gateways).

Understanding these limits is crucial for a scalable, reliable, and efficient architecture. As you scale up, pay attention to:
- The number of backend pools and listeners, as exceeding them may require architectural redesign.
- Consolidating rules and using wildcard SSL certificates to avoid consuming resources unnecessarily.
- Implementing monitoring tools and IaC to manage complex routing and rule combinations.
- Employing autoscaling capabilities to dynamically adjust resources in response to traffic demands.

### Other Considerations & Alternative Design Options:
   - **Azure Front Door**: Consider using Azure Front Door as the global entry point for traffic before reaching the Application Gateway. It provides global load balancing, faster failovers, and additional security (SSL offloading, WAF) for web applications.
     - *Pros*: Global traffic management with additional security and optimization features.
     - *Cons*: More complexity and cost.
   - **Application Gateway Per App**: Instead of using a single Internal App Gateway for multiple applications, consider splitting into multiple Application Gateways per app, especially if these applications need independent scaling or require different security policies.
     - *Pros*: Increased isolation and customization per application.
     - *Cons*: More resource overhead.

### Conclusion:
The design may provides a good separation of concerns and leverages multiple layers of security with gateways and hubs. The key is to fine-tune isolation policies (via NSGs, ASGs), automate configurations (with IaC tools), and scale dynamically while monitoring cost and performance.
